## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a simple music recommender system using a Decision Tree Classifier. The process involves:

Data Preparation: Loading and understanding the dataset.

Model Training: Training a Decision Tree model on the prepared data.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy.

Model Persistence: Saving the trained model for future use.

Model Visualization: Exporting the decision tree structure.

## Files in this Repository
music.csv: The dataset used for training the music recommender model. It likely contains features like age, gender, and the corresponding music genre.

vgsales.csv: An additional dataset, likely explored for data handling and descriptive statistics, demonstrating versatility in dataset manipulation.

uploading dataset.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to load and perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on datasets, including displaying shape, descriptive statistics, and values.

trained model.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for training the DecisionTreeClassifier on the music.csv dataset. It also shows how to persist the trained model using joblib and how to export the decision tree structure to a .dot file for visualization.

music-recommender.dot: The graphical representation of the trained Decision Tree model, generated from trained model.ipynb. This file can be visualized using Graphviz to understand the decision-making process of the model.

testing model accuracy.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook dedicated to evaluating the performance of the trained model. It demonstrates splitting data into training and testing sets and calculating the accuracy of the model using accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics.

## How to Run the Notebooks
To run these Jupyter Notebooks, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter installed.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
cd YourRepositoryName

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn jupyter

Start Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Open the .ipynb files: Navigate to the respective .ipynb files in your browser and run the cells.

## Key Technologies
Python: The primary programming language used for this project.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: A powerful machine learning library used for building and evaluating the Decision Tree Classifier.

Joblib: For efficient saving and loading of Python objects, specifically the trained machine learning model.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development, experimentation, and documentation of the machine learning workflow.

Graphviz (for .dot file visualization): An open-source graph visualization software (installation separate from Python libraries).

## Skills Demonstrated
This repository highlights the following AI and Machine Learning skills:

Data Loading and Exploration: Proficiently loading and understanding various datasets (.csv files).

Feature Engineering (Implicit): Understanding how features (age, gender) are used in model training.

Supervised Learning: Implementation of a DecisionTreeClassifier for a classification task.

Model Training: Ability to train machine learning models effectively.

Model Evaluation: Competence in assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy.

Model Persistence: Knowledge of saving and loading trained models for deployment or later use.

Model Interpretability: Generating and understanding decision tree visualizations (.dot file).

Version Control: Using Git/GitHub for project management and collaboration.

Reproducible Research: Organizing code in Jupyter Notebooks for clarity and reproducibility.
